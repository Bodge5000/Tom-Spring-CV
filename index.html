            <p>
                My name is Tom, I am a highly motivated self starter with a great track record of proactive development both inside and outside of work. 
                I spend my free time working on solo projects, doing game jams and making music. 
                At Access Screening, where I currently work, I spend my time developing new features in Django, Python and Vue.
            </p>

            <p><strong>Procedural terrain generator</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Currently working on a procedural terrain generator in Godot for my current game project</li>
                <li>Involves transforming a 2D "Height Map" into a 3D mesh by lifting each vertices in the mesh to a height defined by the colour of a given pixel on 
                    the height map</li>
                <li>I've also worked on various 2D world generators for the same project, as well as height map generators</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Music</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>As well as programming, I also make music</li>
                <li>Using Renoise, various hardware synthesisers and more recently, programmatically</li>
                <li>Another side project of mine is building a synthesiser in Javascript which I can then use to compose algorithmically</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Friday Night AutoBrawl</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Built during my time off whilst working at CSS</li>
                <li>A mobile Vehicular Brawler game based on the concept of "Perma-Perma Death"</li>
                <li>In a "Perma Death" game, when a player dies, they must start again. In a "Perma-Perma Death" game, when the player dies, they are permanently locked out 
                    of the game</li>
                <li>Despite being a much talked about concept in gaming, to my knowledge "Friday Night AutoBrawl" is the first and only "Perma-Perma Death" game</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Elevator Pitch</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some time ago I also did some work on a Django app called Elevator Pitch</li>
                <li>The idea was for something like Product Hunt, but with the twist that the "elevator pitch" that is served to a user is decided randomly</li>
                <li>It started out as a solution to a problem with game discoverability, but with a tagging system it became much more general</li>
                <li>Due to other ideas and priorities, it was never finished or released</li>
            </ul>
