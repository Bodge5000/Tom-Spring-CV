> My name is Tom, I am a highly motivated self starter with a great track record of proactive development both inside and outside of work. I spend my free time working on many solo projects, usually game dev related. At Access Screening, where I currently work, I spend my time developing new features in Django, Python and Vue.

## ðŸ“Œ On the Side
**Procedural terrain generator**

- Currently working on a procedural terrain generator in Godot for my main current project
- Involves transforming a 2D "Height Map" into a 3D mesh by lifting each vertices in the mesh to a height defined by the colour of a given pixel on the height map
- Also have worked on various world generators for a 2D space, for the same project

**Friday Night AutoBrawl**

- Built during my time off whilst working at CSS
- A mobile Vehicular Brawler game based on the concept of "Perma-Perma Death"
- In a "Perma Death" game, when a player dies, they must start again. In a "Perma-Perma Death" game, when the player dies, they are permenantly locked out of the game
- Despite being a much talked about concept in gaming, to my knowledge "Friday Night AutoBrawl" is the first and only perma-perma death game

**Notes app**

- As another side project, I'm also in the very early stages of building a very basic notes app in Django
- The idea is for forcefully unorganised notes which can then be sorted or discarded later, by using what is essentially a one person chat app (Slack of WhatsApp being good examples, but again, for one person)

**Image to JSON**

- A small python script I built recently that turns a single or multiple image files into a JSON array
- The Json file contains the position of pixel in the primary image as the key, and then an ID assigned the colour of that pixel as the value
- The idea of this is so that I can create maps for games graphically, which I find more intuitive, but then the data from those maps can be processed in JSON, which is much more performant than reading pixel values at runtime.
